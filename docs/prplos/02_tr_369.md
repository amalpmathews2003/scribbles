# TR-369 (USP) and prplOS

As the number of connected devices in homes and businesses skyrockets, managing them efficiently, securely, and at scale is a growing challenge for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and network administrators. The **User Services Platform (USP)**, also known as **TR-369**, is a modern protocol by the Broadband Forum that builds on the legacy of TR-069 to deliver advanced remote device management. When paired with **prplOS**, an OpenWRT-based operating system optimized for embedded devices, TR-369 enables a robust, flexible, and secure solution for managing broadband and IoT ecosystems. In this blog, we explore TR-369, its architecture, and how prplOS leverages it to streamline device management.

## What is TR-369 (USP)?

TR-369, or the User Services Platform, is an evolution of the TR-069 CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP), introduced by the Broadband Forum in 2018. While TR-069 revolutionized remote management for broadband devices like routers and gateways, TR-369 extends these capabilities to address the needs of modern networks, including IoT, smart homes, and 5G environments. USP is designed for real-time, scalable, and secure management of connected devices, offering enhanced flexibility over its predecessor.

### Key Features of TR-369
- **Real-Time Management**: Event-driven communication for instant device updates, unlike TR-069’s polling-based approach.
- **Multi-Controller Architecture**: Supports multiple controllers (e.g., ACS, mobile apps, or local devices) managing a single device, breaking TR-069’s 1:1 ACS-to-CPE model.
- **Security**: Implements TLS/DTLS encryption, role-based access control (RBAC), and trust mechanisms for secure communication.
- **IoT Support**: Manages diverse devices (e.g., routers, IoT sensors, smart home hubs) via standardized TR-181 Device:2 data models.
- **Flexible Transports**: Supports multiple Message Transfer Protocols (MTPs) like WebSocket, MQTT, STOMP, and CoAP for efficient communication.
- **Interoperability**: Ensures vendor-agnostic management through standardized data models and protocols.

USP enables lifecycle management (provisioning, monitoring, firmware updates, diagnostics) for devices ranging from Wi-Fi routers to IoT endpoints, making it ideal for complex, multi-device networks.[](https://avsystem.com/blog/csp/tr-369)[](https://motive.com/glossary/what-is-tr-369)


## TR-369 Architecture in prplOS

The architecture of TR-369 in prplOS, as described in the Oktopus documentation, involves a network of **USP Agents** and **USP Controllers** interacting over Message Transfer Protocols (MTPs). This integrates seamlessly with prplOS’s OpenWRT-based stack.

### Components
- **USP Agent (CPE)**: Embedded in prplOS devices (e.g., routers, gateways), the agent exposes service elements (objects and parameters) defined in the TR-181 Device:2 data model. It handles requests from controllers and sends notifications for subscribed events.
- **USP Controller (ACS)**: A server or application (e.g., cloud-based ACS, mobile app, or local device) that sends commands to manage devices (e.g., `Add`, `Set`, `Delete`) and subscribes to notifications.
- **Message Transfer Protocols (MTPs)**: Supports WebSocket, MQTT, STOMP, or CoAP for message transport, with USP Records ensuring message integrity and security.
- **UCI and ubus**: In prplOS, the USP Agent uses UCI to store configurations (e.g., `/etc/config/usp`) and ubus to communicate with daemons like `netifd` for network management.
- **DNS/DHCP**: Resolves controller URLs and provides configuration via DHCP Option 43 or mDNS discovery.

### Data Flow
1. **Discovery**: The USP Agent discovers controllers using pre-configured URLs, DNS-SD, or mDNS. DHCP Option 43 may provide controller details.
2. **Session Initiation**: The agent sends a `Notify` message (e.g., for boot or value change events) to the controller over an MTP like WebSocket.
3. **Management**:
   - **Configuration**: Controllers send `Set` or `Add` requests to update parameters (e.g., Wi-Fi SSID), which the agent maps to UCI configs.
   - **Firmware Updates**: Controllers issue `Operate` requests to trigger firmware downloads, applied via prplOS’s `sysupgrade`.
   - **Diagnostics**: Controllers request diagnostics (e.g., ping tests) via `Get` or `Operate`.
4. **Notifications**: The agent sends event notifications (e.g., `ValueChange`) to subscribed controllers.
5. **Security**: TLS/DTLS encrypts communication, with RBAC ensuring controllers access only authorized parameters.

In prplOS, the USP Agent interacts with the OpenWRT kernel and SoC via netlink (for network tasks) and ubus (for daemon coordination), ensuring seamless hardware integration.[](https://avsystem.com/blog/csp/tr-369)[](https://service.snom.com/display/wiki/TR-369)

### Example Workflow
- **Wi-Fi Configuration**:
  1. A controller sends a `Set` request to update `Device.WiFi.SSID.1.SSID` to "MyNetwork".
  2. The USP Agent updates `/etc/config/wireless` via UCI.
  3. The agent notifies `netifd` via ubus to apply the new SSID.
  4. The kernel and SoC configure the Wi-Fi hardware.
  5. The agent sends a response confirming the change.

## Why TR-369 with prplOS?
Combining TR-369 with prplOS offers compelling benefits for ISPs, developers, and end users:

- **Zero-Touch Provisioning**: Devices auto-configure upon connecting to a controller, reducing manual setup.[](https://motive.com/glossary/what-is-tr-369)
- **Scalability**: TR-369’s multi-controller architecture supports managing millions of devices, ideal for prplOS’s lightweight design.[](https://www.incognito.com/insights/usp-tr369)
- **IoT and Smart Home Support**: Manages diverse devices (e.g., IoT sensors, Wi-Fi APs) using standardized data models, enhanced by prplOS’s modularity.[](https://service.snom.com/display/wiki/TR-369)
- **Security**: TLS encryption, RBAC, and prplOS’s secure boot ensure robust protection.[](https://motive.com/glossary/what-is-tr-369)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Supports TR-069 alongside TR-369, easing migration for existing OpenWRT deployments.[](https://www.incognito.com/tutorials/tr-369-usp)
- **Cross-Platform Portability**: prplOS’s collaboration with the Broadband Forum enables portable applications via USP’s standardized APIs.[](https://prplfoundation.org/broadband-forum-and-prpl-foundation-unite-to-create-a-secure-cross-platform-service-delivery-framework/)

## Implementing TR-369 in prplOS
To integrate TR-369 into a prplOS device, follow these steps:

1. **Install USP Agent**:
   - Use `opkg` to install a USP agent (e.g., `ob-usp-agent`, an open-source reference implementation).[](https://www.minim.com/blog/what-is-tr-369-user-services-platform)
   - Example: `opkg install ob-usp-agent`.

2. **Configure USP Settings**:
   - Edit `/etc/config/usp` to set controller details:
     ```bash
     config usp
         option controller_url 'wss://acs.example.com'
         option endpoint_id 'prplos::router1'
         option mtp 'websocket'
         option enable_tls '1'
     ```

3. **Integrate with UCI and ubus**:
   - Map TR-369 parameters to UCI configs (e.g., `Device.WiFi.SSID` to `/etc/config/wireless`).
   - Use ubus to notify daemons like `netifd` or `dnsmasq`.

4. **Test Connectivity**:
   - Verify agent status: `ubus call usp status`.
   - Check logs: `logread | grep usp`.
   - Test controller communication: Send a `Get` request to retrieve `Device.DeviceInfo`.

5. **Enable Notifications**:
   - Configure the agent to send periodic `Notify` messages for events like `Boot` or `ValueChange`.

## Challenges and Considerations
- **Resource Constraints**: TR-369’s real-time communication can strain low-memory devices. prplOS’s lightweight design mitigates this, but optimize MTPs (e.g., use CoAP for IoT).[](https://service.snom.com/display/wiki/TR-369)
- **Security**: Ensure TLS certificates are properly configured and prplOS’s secure boot is enabled to prevent unauthorized access.[](https://motive.com/glossary/what-is-tr-369)
- **Interoperability**: Test against Broadband Forum’s BBF.369 certification to ensure compatibility with ACS vendors.[](https://www.qacafe.com/resources/user-services-platform-tr-369-overview/)
- **Migration from TR-069**: Use dual-stack agents to support both protocols during transition, leveraging prplOS’s compatibility with TR-181.[](https://www.incognito.com/tutorials/tr-369-usp)
