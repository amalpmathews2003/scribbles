# OpenWRT Overview

## What is OpenWRT?

OpenWRT is an open-source, Linux-based operating system designed primarily for embedded devices, such as routers, to replace their factory firmware. It provides a customizable, lightweight, and highly flexible platform for networking devices, offering advanced features like enhanced security, network optimization, and extensibility through a package management system. Unlike traditional router firmware, OpenWRT allows users to configure and extend device functionality, supporting a wide range of hardware.

### Key Features:
- **Customizable Firmware**: Tailor network configurations, protocols, and services.
- **Package Management**: Install additional software via the opkg package manager.
- **Open-Source**: Freely available source code, enabling community contributions.
- **Wide Hardware Support**: Compatible with numerous router brands and models.

## History and Evolution of OpenWRT

OpenWRT began in 2004 as a project to create open-source firmware for the Linksys WRT54G router, leveraging the Linux kernel. Its origins trace back to the availability of the WRT54G’s source code under the GPL license, which allowed developers to build custom firmware. Over time, OpenWRT evolved into a versatile embedded Linux distribution.

### Milestones:
- 2004: Initial release focused on Linksys WRT54G.
- 2006-2010: Expanded hardware support and introduced the opkg package manager.
- 2013: Forked into LEDE (Linux Embedded Development Environment) due to community disagreements.
- 2016-2020: LEDE and OpenWRT merged back in 2016, with unified releases under the OpenWRT name.
- Recent Developments: Regular updates (e.g., OpenWRT 23.05 in 2023) with improved hardware support, modern kernel versions (Linux 5.x), and features like WPA3, WireGuard VPN, and better IoT integration.

## OpenWRT vs Traditional Linux Distros for Embedded Devices

OpenWRT differs from traditional Linux distributions (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu) in its focus on embedded systems with constrained resources. Below is a comparison:

| Aspect                  | OpenWRT                                                                 | Traditional Linux Distros                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**             | Optimized for routers, IoT, and networking devices.                     | General-purpose for servers, desktops, or embedded systems.    |
| **Resource Usage**      | Lightweight, designed for low-memory (4-16 MB RAM) and flash storage (4-8 MB). | Often resource-heavy, requiring more storage and memory.       |
| **File System**         | Uses squashfs/jffs2 for read-only and writable partitions.              | Typically uses ext4 or other general-purpose file systems.     |
| **Package Management**  | opkg for minimal, network-focused packages.                             | apt/yum/dnf for broader software ecosystems.                   |
| **Kernel Customization**| Stripped-down Linux kernel tailored for networking tasks.               | Full-featured kernel with broader hardware support.            |
| **Configuration**       | UCI (Unified Configuration Interface) for simplified network settings.  | Varies (e.g., systemd, manual configs).                        |
| **Use Case**            | Routers, gateways, IoT devices with specific networking needs.          | General computing, servers, or embedded with custom builds.    |

OpenWRT’s advantage lies in its networking focus, minimal footprint, and community-driven hardware support, while traditional distros offer more flexibility for non-networking embedded use cases.

## Use Cases in Routers, IoT, and Broadband Devices

OpenWRT’s flexibility makes it suitable for various applications:

### Routers:
- **Advanced Networking**: Supports VLANs, QoS, VPNs (WireGuard, OpenVPN), and IPv6 for custom routing.
- **Performance Optimization**: Overclocking, custom DNS, and traffic shaping for low-latency gaming or streaming.
- **Security**: Firewall enhancements, intrusion detection, and secure remote access.
- **Example**: Replacing stock firmware on a TP-Link Archer C7 for better Wi-Fi performance.

### IoT Devices:
- **Gateway**: Acts as a central hub for IoT devices, supporting protocols like MQTT, Zigbee, or Z-Wave (with additional packages).
- **Custom Applications**: Run lightweight servers (e.g., Node-RED) for home automation.
- **Example**: Using OpenWRT on a Raspberry Pi as an IoT gateway for smart home devices.

### Broadband Devices:
- **Modem Support**: Manages DSL, cable, or 4G/5G modems for customized connectivity.
- **Load Balancing**: Combines multiple internet connections for redundancy or speed.
- **Example**: Configuring OpenWRT on a MikroTik router for multi-WAN failover.

### Other Use Cases:
- **Mesh Networking**: Creates Wi-Fi mesh networks for extended coverage.
- **Research & Development**: Prototyping network solutions or testing new protocols.
- **Privacy Tools**: Running Tor or ad-blocking services like Pi-hole.

## OpenWRT Licensing and Community Ecosystem

### Licensing:
- OpenWRT is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 (GPLv2), ensuring the source code is freely available and modifications must be shared.
- Some packages may use other open-source licenses (e.g., MIT, BSD), but the core system adheres to GPLv2.
- This licensing fosters transparency and community contributions but requires manufacturers to release source code for derivative works.

### Community Ecosystem:
- **Development**: Driven by a global community of developers, with contributions via GitHub and the OpenWRT wiki.
- **Support**: Active forums, IRC channels, and mailing lists provide troubleshooting and advice.
- **Hardware Database**: A community-maintained list of supported devices, helping users choose compatible hardware.
- **Packages**: Thousands of packages available via opkg, from VPNs to web servers, maintained by contributors.
- **Events & Collaboration**: Community meetups, hackathons, and integration with projects like LEDE (pre-merge) and Freifunk (mesh networking).

The ecosystem thrives on volunteer efforts, with no formal corporate backing, though some companies (e.g., Prusa Research, Turris) contribute hardware or funding. Users can participate by reporting bugs, developing packages, or donating to sustain development.
