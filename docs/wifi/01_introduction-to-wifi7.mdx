# Introduction to Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be)

Wi-Fi 7 — officially IEEE 802.11be Extremely High Throughput (EHT) — represents the biggest leap in wireless networking since Wi-Fi 5 introduced gigabit speeds.

The demand for faster, lower-latency, more reliable wireless connections is exploding due to:

 - 4K/8K streaming
 - AR/VR/XR applications
 - Online competitive gaming
 - Smart homes with 50–200 devices
 - Remote/hybrid work
 - Multi-AP mesh networks
 - Cloud computing and edge AI workloads
 
Wi-Fi 6/6E delivered efficiency and capacity.  
Wi-Fi 7 delivers raw performance + ultra-low latency + reliability.

Let’s break down what makes Wi-Fi 7 revolutionary.

## 1. Multi-Link Operation (MLO)

Traditional Wi-Fi connects to one band at a time:  
2.4 GHz or 5 GHz or 6 GHz.

Wi-Fi 7 lets your device connect to multiple bands simultaneously.
This is called Multi-Link Operation (MLO) and it brings:

✔  **Higher throughput**  
Data flows in parallel across radios — like adding extra lanes to a highway.  
✔ **Lower latency**  
If one band gets congested, traffic instantly switches to another.  
✔ **Better reliability**  
Two links mean redundancy; if one link suffers interference, the other continues.
✔ **Smoother roaming**  
Your phone stays connected even while moving between APs.

MLO is the #1 reason Wi-Fi 7 outperforms previous generations.

## 2. Ultra-Wide 320 MHz Channels

Wi-Fi 6 introduced 160 MHz channels.  
Wi-Fi 7 doubles that to 320 MHz channels (only available in 6 GHz).

This means:
- 2× the bandwidth  
- Higher top-end speeds  
- Better performance in homes/offices with many devices

## 3. 4K-QAM Modulation

Higher-order modulation = more bits per transmission.

| Wi-Fi  Gen    | Max Modulation | Bits per Symbol       |
|----------|:---:|-----------:|
| Wi-Fi 5    | 256-QAM  | 8 bits   |
| Wi-Fi 6      | 1024-QAM  | 10 bits  |
| Wi-Fi 7     | 4096-QAM  | 12 bits  |

## 4. Multi-RU & Punctured Transmission (Better OFDMA)

Wi-Fi 6 introduced OFDMA.  
Wi-Fi 7 upgrades it with:

✔ Multi-RU allocation  
One client can receive multiple frequency blocks at once, increasing efficiency.

✔ Advanced puncturing  
Wi-Fi 7 can “skip” noisy portions of a channel.
Previously, the entire channel had to be abandoned if a portion was unusable.


## 5. Improved Security (WPA3 + PMF + 6 GHz Rules)

Wi-Fi 7 mandates strong security on the 6 GHz band:

 - **WPA3-SAE** (mandatory encryption)  
Prevents offline dictionary attacks.
 - **OWE** for secure open networks  
Encryption without passwords.
 - **PMF** (Management Frame Protection)  
Stops deauthentication/DoS/evil-twin attacks.
 - **Enhanced device certification**  
6 GHz devices must follow strict rules for power, AFC, and interference control.
