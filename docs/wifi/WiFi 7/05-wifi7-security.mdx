# Wi-Fi 7 Security

Wi-Fi 7 isn’t just about speed — it is the first Wi-Fi generation built with modern security assumptions.

Earlier Wi-Fi standards assumed:
  - Trusted environments
  - Weak attackers
  - Few devices
  - Minimal mobility

Wi-Fi 7 security is designed for:
 - Dense deployments
 - Public networks
 - Multi-link connections
 - Zero-trust assumptions
 - Continuous mobility

## 1. Why WPA2 Is No Longer Enough

WPA2-PSK (used by most Wi-Fi networks today) has a fundamental design flaw:  
```The authentication handshake can be captured and cracked offline.```

WPA2 problem summary:
 - 4-way handshake is observable
 - Attacker captures handshake once
 - Unlimited offline password guesses
 - GPU-accelerated dictionary attacks
 - Weak passwords fall in minutes
 
This is not a bug — it is a protocol limitation.

# 2. WPA3 Is Mandatory in Wi-Fi 7 (Especially 6 GHz)

Wi-Fi 7 requires WPA3 on the 6 GHz band.

Allowed security modes in 6 GHz:
 - WPA3-Personal (SAE)
 - WPA3-Enterprise
 - OWE (Enhanced Open)

🚫 WPA2 is forbidden  
🚫 Open (unencrypted) Wi-Fi is forbidden


## 3. SAE: How WPA3 Stops Dictionary Attacks

WPA3 replaces PSK with SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals).

What SAE changes:

| WPA2               | WPA3-SAE                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Static PSK         | Password-authenticated key exchange |
| Offline cracking   | Impossible                        |
| Unlimited guesses  |  Rate-limited                      |
| No forward secrecy |  Forward secrecy                   |

Why SAE is secure:
 - Uses elliptic-curve cryptography
 - No reusable password-derived hashes
 - Each guess requires live AP interaction
 - AP can throttle or block attempts

Even weak passwords become dramatically harder to attack.


## 4. PMF (Protected Management Frames) Is Now Required

Before WPA3, management frames were unauthenticated.

Attackers could:
 - Send fake deauth frames
 - Kick users off networks
 - Force evil-twin connections
 - Break roaming and calls

PMF (802.11w) protects:
 - Deauthentication
 - Disassociation
 - Action frames
 
Result:
 - Deauth attacks no longer work
 - Roaming is safer
 - Mesh networks become stable

## 5. OWE: Secure Open Wi-Fi (No Passwords, Still Encrypted)

OWE (Opportunistic Wireless Encryption) solves a long-standing problem:
```How do you encrypt public Wi-Fi without passwords?```

OWE provides:
 - Encryption without authentication
 - Per-client keys
 - No shared secrets
 - Protection from passive sniffing


## 6.Enterprise Security in Wi-Fi 7

Wi-Fi 7 supports:
 - WPA3-Enterprise
 - 192-bit security mode
 - EAP-TLS
 - Certificate-based auth
 - Zero-trust networking


# Final Takeaways
 - WPA3 eliminates offline cracking
 - PMF blocks deauth & spoofing
 - OWE secures public Wi-Fi
 - MLO security prevents link abuse
 - 6 GHz enforces modern defaults
