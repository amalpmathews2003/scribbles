# Wi-Fi 7 Spectrum Explained: 6 GHz, 320 MHz, DFS & AFC

Wi-Fi 7’s headline features — 320 MHz channels, multi-gigabit speeds, and low latency — are only possible because of spectrum changes, not magic PHY tricks.

To understand Wi-Fi 7 properly, you must understand:
 - Why 6 GHz exists
 - Why 320 MHz only works there
 - Why DFS still matters
 - Why AFC will shape the future of Wi-Fi 7.  
 
Let’s break it down.


## 1. Why Spectrum Is the Real Bottleneck in Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi performance is limited by how much clean radio spectrum is available.

Legacy problems:
 - 2.4 GHz → crowded, narrow, noisy
 - 5 GHz → fragmented, DFS restrictions, radar interference

Wi-Fi 6 improved efficiency, but spectrum was still limited.

Wi-Fi 7 solves this by:
 - Expanding into 6 GHz
 - Allowing wider contiguous channels
 - Reducing legacy compatibility overhead

## 2. The 6 GHz Band: The Wi-Fi Superhighway

The 6 GHz band (roughly 5925–7125 MHz, varies by country) is the largest spectrum expansion in Wi-Fi history.

What makes 6 GHz special?
 - No legacy Wi-Fi devices
 - No microwave ovens
 - No Bluetooth
 - No backward-compatibility overhead

Only Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 devices are allowed.

#### Channel availability

Channel Width | Number of Channels|   
--- | ---| 
20 MHz | 59 |
40 MHz| 29 |
80 MHz| 14 |
160 MHz| 7 |
320 MHz| 3 |


## 3. Why 320 MHz Channels Are a Big Deal

 - Twice the subcarriers
 - Twice the raw throughput
 - Lower scheduling overhead
 - Better efficiency for MLO

Important reality check:
 - 320 MHz only works in 6 GHz
 - It requires a clean RF environment
 - Best suited for homes, offices, and mesh backhaul

In dense apartments, 160 MHz + MLO may perform better.

## 4. Why 5 GHz Still Matters (and Why DFS Exists)

The 5 GHz band still carries much of today’s Wi-Fi traffic — including Wi-Fi 7.
But it has a problem: radar systems.

#### DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection)

DFS exists to protect:
 - Weather radar
 - Military radar
 - Aviation systems

What DFS forces APs to do:
 - Scan channel before use (CAC)
 - Vacate channel if radar is detected
 - Move clients to a new channel

Why this hurts performance:
 - Sudden channel switches
 - Client reconnect delays
 - Throughput drops

### Wi-Fi 7’s Improvement: Smarter DFS Handling

 - ✔ MLO fallback  
If 5 GHz DFS triggers → traffic instantly shifts to 6 GHz.
 - ✔ Punctured transmission  
If part of a wide channel is noisy, Wi-Fi 7 avoids only that section.
 - ✔ Faster channel switching  
Improved coordination reduces downtime.


DFS doesn’t disappear — Wi-Fi 7 just makes it less painful.

## 6. AFC (Automated Frequency Coordination):

AFC is a cloud-based coordination system for 6 GHz.

#### Why AFC is needed:

Some 6 GHz frequencies are used by:
 - Fixed microwave links
 - Outdoor point-to-point radios 
 
AFC ensures Wi-Fi devices:
 - Know where they are (geo-location)
 - Query a database
 - Use only safe frequencies

AFC enables:
 - Higher power Wi-Fi 7
 - Outdoor Wi-Fi 7 APs
 - Long-range mesh links
