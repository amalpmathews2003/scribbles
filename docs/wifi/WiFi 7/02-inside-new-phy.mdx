# Inside Wi-Fi 7’s New PHY: The EHT Revolution

Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be) introduces the EHT — Extremely High Throughput PHY, which is the biggest physical-layer upgrade since Wi-Fi 5 (11ac).

## 1. What Is the EHT PHY?

EHT (Extremely High Throughput) is the Wi-Fi 7 physical layer, designed to:

 - Support multi-gigabit throughput
 - Reduce latency significantly
 - Operate efficiently in crowded spectrum
 - Work flexibly across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz
 - Enable multi-link operation (MLO

EHT introduces enhancements in:
 - OFDM
 - Channel width
 - Modulation
 - Multiple user scheduling
 - Spatial streams
 - Resource allocatio

## 2.Ultra-Wide Channel Support: 320 MHz

Wi-Fi 7 doubles the max channel width of Wi-Fi 6.  
A 320 MHz channel can carry 2× more subcarriers, giving higher throughput with the same modulation.

#### Why it's important

The 6 GHz spectrum introduced in Wi-Fi 6E enables clean, wide channels — and Wi-Fi 7 capitalizes on that by creating highways for multi-gigabit traffic.

Example PHY peak for 2×2 Wi-Fi 7:
 - 160 MHz → ~5.8 Gbps
 - 320 MHz → ~11.5 Gbps

## 3. 4K-QAM: Higher-Order Modulation

</p>

| Modulation    | Bits Per Symbol | Improvement       |
|----------|:---:|-----------:|
| 1024-QAM    | 10 bits  |   |
| 4096-QAM     | 12 bits  | +20% throughput  |

This means more data per OFDM symbol — but it requires:
 - Strong signal
 - High SNR
 - Low interference

This upgrade is most beneficial when close to the AP.

## 4.More Efficient OFDMA with Multi-RU Allocation

Wi-Fi 6 introduced OFDMA.  
Wi-Fi 7 upgrades it with more flexibility.

##### Wi-Fi 6:
1 user = 1 RU (Resource Unit)
##### Wi-Fi 7:
1 user = multiple RUs at the same time

```
Client A → RU1 + RU3
Client B → RU2
Client C → RU4 + RU5
```

#### Why this matters
 - Increased per-user throughput
 - Better utilization in mixed-traffic environments
 - Solves Wi-Fi 6’s rigid allocation problem  
 
This is crucial for dense deployments like apartments and offices.


## 5. Preamble Puncturing 2.0

</p>

Wi-Fi 6E allowed basic punctured transmissions (skip noisy channels).  
Wi-Fi 7 expands this dramatically. 

#### What’s new?
 - Skip multiple sub-channels
 - Use all clean spectrum
 - Avoid DFS channels with radar interference
 - Allow 320 MHz to work even if a portion is unusable

Example:  
If 40 MHz of a 320 MHz channel is noisy, Wi-Fi 7 uses the remaining 280 MHz without downgrading.

## 6. 16 Spatial Streams (Theoretical Maximum)

Wi-Fi 5/6 allow up to 8 spatial streams.  
Wi-Fi 7 increases this to 16 spatial streams.  

#### Why it matters 
 - More streams → higher capacity 
 - Better MU-MIMO performance 
 - Enables multi-user parallelism  
 
Note: Most consumer devices will not implement all 16 streams, but APs may use them for serving multiple clients.


## ❤️ Why the EHT PHY Matters

The EHT PHY is not just about speed — it improves the entire Wi-Fi experience: 
 - Higher speeds (multi-gigabit) 
 - Better handling of congestion 
 - More reliable channels 
 - Significantly lower latency 
 - Support for next-gen devices (AR/VR/XR, cloud gaming) 
 - Power-efficient operations for IoT & mobile
 
Wi-Fi 7 finally brings Wi-Fi closer to the stability of wired Ethernet.
