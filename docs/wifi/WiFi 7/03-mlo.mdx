# Multi-Link Operation (MLO): The Heart of Wi-Fi 7

If there is ONE reason Wi-Fi 7 feels dramatically faster and smoother than every prior Wi-Fi generation, it’s MLO — Multi-Link Operation.

Everything else (320 MHz, 4K-QAM, OFDMA upgrades) boosts speed.
But MLO boosts experience: latency, stability, roaming, and reliability.


## 1. What Is MLO in Wi-Fi 7?
Traditionally, a Wi-Fi device connects to only one band at a time:
 - 2.4 GHz or
 - 5 GHz or
 - 6 GHz

Even if your router has multiple bands, your phone/laptop uses only one active link at any moment.

### Wi-Fi 7 changes everything
Wi-Fi 7 devices can connect to multiple bands and channels simultaneously.  
This means: 
 - More throughput 
 - Lower latency 
 - Better reliability 
 - Instant fallback if one link is congested 
 - Smoother roaming between APs   
 
This makes Wi-Fi behave more like multi-path TCP or dual-WAN bonding, but done at the MAC layer.


## 2. What Is an MLD (Multi-Link Device)?

To support MLO, both the AP and client become MLDs:
 - AP-MLD = One router with multiple coordinated radios (2.4 / 5 / 6 GHz)
 - STA-MLD = A phone/laptop with multiple Wi-Fi chains  
 
 Each link is called an MLD Link.

Example:  
Your laptop might connect to a Wi-Fi 7 router like this:

Band | Channel| Link ID | Status
--- | --- | --- | ---
5 GHz | 80 MHz | Link 0  | Connected
6 GHz | 160 MHz | Link 1 | Connected

Traffic flows over both at the same time.


## 3. Three Modes of MLO

MLO is not one feature — it is a set of parallel multi-link behaviors.  

### Mode 1 — Striped MLO (High Throughput Mode)

Traffic is split across links in parallel.

```
Packet 1 → 5 GHz
Packet 2 → 6 GHz
Packet 3 → 5 GHz
Packet 4 → 6 GHz
```
Benefits:
 - Maximum speed
 - Maximum bandwidth 
 - Better load balancing  

Best for:
 - Downloads
 - Streaming
 - File transfers
 - Multi-gigabit routers


### Mode 2 — Redundant MLO (Low Latency Mode)

The same packet is sent across multiple links:
```
Packet A → 5 GHz  
Packet A → 6 GHz  
First to succeed wins
```

Benefits: 
 - Ultra-low latency 
 - Zero-lag gaming 
 - No stutter for AR/VR/XR 
 - Best reliability

Used by: 
 - Gaming devices 
 - VR headsets 
 - Real-time workloads

This is how Wi-Fi 7 achieves wired-like consistency.

### Mode 3 — Link Steering (Adaptive Mode)

The AP and client dynamically choose the best link for each moment.

Examples:
 - 6 GHz gets interfered → instantly move to 5 GHz
 - DFS event in 5 GHz → instantly move to 6 GHz
 - AP wants to reduce congestion → push client to cleaner link

This eliminates:
 - Random lag spikes
 - Reconnect delays
 - Roaming drops


## 4. Limitations of MLO

 - Client must also support MLO  
 Old devices get NO benefit.
 - Only certain band combinations work  
5+6 GHz most common.
2.4 GHz used mostly for steering/fallback.
 -  More power consumption on clients  
Phones must activate multiple radios at once — mitigated by power save modes.
 - Routers must have multiple RF chains  
Cheap routers won’t support full multi-link.

## 5. How MLO Works Internally

### New MLME Layer
Wi-Fi 7 introduces Multi-Link Management Entity (MLME):
 - Manages all links
 - Coordinates traffic
 - Handles ML authentication
 - Exchanges ML-beacons & ML-IEs

### Single MLD MAC Address
An MLD uses one MAC address for all links, simplifying routing.

### Per-Link PHY
Each link can have:
 - Different channel width
 - Different modulation
 - Different power
 - Different RF chain
 
### MLO Authentication 
MLO authentication = secure handshake for all links:
 - Primary link is authenticated (SAE/WPA3)
 - Other links are attached securely
 - One security context shared across links

This reduces handshake overhead.
